Definitions:

-Engine
	-Cylinders
		-Total Volume
		-Current Volume
		-Temperature
	-Pistons
		-Crank Radius or Half Stroke Length
		-Crank Angle
		-Rod Length
		-Current Height
	-Engine Efficiency = 33% 

	ex. 4 cylinder 4 stroke
		-1 cycle = 2 combustion reactions

-Air
	-Density @ 20C = 1.2041 kg/m^3
	-Percentage Comp in Mass
		-Nitrogen = 75.52%
		-Oxygen = 23.14%

-Gasoline
	-Energy Density of Gasoline = 45 kJ/g
	-Density of Gasoline = 0.7489 g/cm^3 or g/ml

	-Combustion of Gasoline
		-Reactants
			-1 mol or 114.22852 g of gasoline 
			-12.5 moles or 399.985 g of O2 or 1728.5436 g of air
		-Products
			-8 moles or 352.076 g of CO2
			-9 moles or 162.13752 g of H2O
		

Features:
	-User gets to modulate throttle (open/close throttle body to let in air)
	-Will graph live (rpm vs torque/power)
	-Combustion will push piston down
	W=Fd

	45 kJ * 33% = F * Stroke Length

	40 rps = 80 combustion reactions per second

	1.5 kJ * 80 = 120 kW
	


Process:
	1. Calculate fuel in grams to inject from air entering engine
		a. Based on optimal 15.13 air fuel ratio 
	2. 
	
	2. Display data on graph
